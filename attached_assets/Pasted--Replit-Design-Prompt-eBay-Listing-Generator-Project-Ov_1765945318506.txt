# Replit Design Prompt: eBay Listing Generator

## Project Overview
Design a friction-free, elegant web application for streamlining the process of creating eBay listings from inventory items. The app should minimize clicks, reduce cognitive load, and create a delightful experience for users managing multiple product listings.

## Core User Flow

### 1. Data Access & Inventory Management
- **Primary Action**: Fetch items from WholeCell inventory system marked "ready for eBay listing"
- **UI Element**: Prominent "Refresh Inventory" button with visual feedback
- **Display**: Sidebar list showing:
  - Item name/product identifier
  - Status badge (Ready, In Progress, Completed)
  - Last updated date
  - Visual indicators for completion state

### 2. Photo Capture & Management
- **Primary Action**: Capture/store photos for selected items
- **Interaction**: Click item → Photo capture interface appears
- **Features**:
  - Drag-and-drop or click-to-upload photo interface
  - Live preview of uploaded photos
  - Photo URL storage linked to each item
  - Visual gallery with ability to reorder/delete photos
  - Progress indicator showing photo count

### 3. AI-Powered Listing Generation
- **Primary Action**: Generate eBay listing description using AI
- **Trigger**: Automatic generation when photos are added, or manual "Generate Listing" button
- **Display**: 
  - Loading state with progress indicator
  - Preview of generated listing (title, description, key features)
  - Edit capability for fine-tuning
  - Save draft functionality

### 4. Export & Completion
- **Primary Action**: Export completed listings to CSV format for eBay import
- **UI Element**: "Export to CSV" button (enabled when item is complete)
- **Feedback**: Success notification with download link
- **Status Update**: Automatically mark item as "Completed" after export

## Design Principles

### Friction-Free Experience
- **Minimal Clicks**: Complete entire workflow for one item in as few interactions as possible
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show only what's needed at each step
- **Smart Defaults**: Auto-populate fields where possible, reduce manual input
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Power user features for rapid workflow
- **Bulk Actions**: Ability to process multiple items efficiently

### Elegance & Visual Design
- **Clean, Modern Aesthetic**: 
  - Minimalist interface with generous whitespace
  - Subtle shadows and depth for hierarchy
  - Smooth animations and transitions (200-300ms)
  - Modern color palette (consider: soft blues, grays, with accent colors for status)
  
- **Visual Hierarchy**:
  - Clear focus states and hover effects
  - Status badges with intuitive color coding
  - Typography scale that guides the eye
  - Consistent spacing system (8px grid recommended)

- **Micro-interactions**:
  - Subtle hover states on interactive elements
  - Loading skeletons instead of spinners
  - Success animations (checkmarks, confetti for completed items)
  - Smooth transitions between states

### Layout Structure

**Main Layout:**
- **Left Sidebar (25-30% width)**: 
  - Inventory list with search/filter
  - Status filters (All, Ready, In Progress, Completed)
  - Refresh button at top
  
- **Main Content Area (70-75% width)**:
  - Contextual panel that changes based on selected item
  - Three main views:
    1. **Item Details View**: Basic product info from WholeCell
    2. **Photo Management View**: Upload, preview, organize photos
    3. **Listing Preview View**: Generated listing with edit capabilities
  
- **Top Bar**:
  - App title/branding
  - Global actions (Export All, Settings)
  - User indicator/status

### Interaction Patterns

**Item Selection Flow:**
1. Click item in sidebar → Main panel slides in with item details
2. Tab navigation or step indicator: Details → Photos → Listing → Export
3. Auto-save progress as user moves through steps
4. Visual progress indicator showing completion status

**Photo Capture Flow:**
- Large, inviting drop zone
- Multiple upload methods: drag-drop, click to browse, camera (if available)
- Instant preview with ability to crop/rotate
- Photo count badge showing "X of 12 photos" (eBay limit)
- Auto-trigger listing generation when minimum photos added

**Listing Generation Flow:**
- Show AI generation in progress with engaging animation
- Display generated content in formatted preview (mimics eBay listing appearance)
- Inline editing with rich text capabilities
- Real-time character/word count
- Validation indicators (e.g., "Title length optimal", "Description complete")

**Export Flow:**
- One-click export button (prominent, always visible)
- Export options: Single item or bulk export
- Success state: Download link + "Mark as Complete" option
- Export history/log for reference
